# GifTastic
- Unit 6 Homework of UT Coding boot camp
- This website is design to be able to display gif images.
- They are initial 5 buttons created but the users can create as many as they want, but not repeated.
- When the users click on each button, initially will display 10 gif images.
- Then, when users scroll down, automatically will display 15 aditional gif images.
- If user moves over the image it will change the state of the imaged and when the mouse leave
it will stop.
